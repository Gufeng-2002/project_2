\section{Results}
We applied iClusterVB on simulated data with 100 individuals across four data views. The model accurately determined $K=3$, consistent with ground truth. Cluster sizes were:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cluster 1: 20 individuals
  \item Cluster 2: 23 individuals
  \item Cluster 3: 57 individuals
\end{itemize}

This demonstrated high accuracy in subgroup detection. Feature selection was not activated but could be useful in further analyses.
