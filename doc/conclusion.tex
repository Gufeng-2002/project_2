\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Summary of Findings:} iClusterVB effectively clusters high-dimensional, mixed-type data, demonstrating robust performance across various datasets. It provides meaningful insights into the underlying structure of complex data, enabling the identification of distinct subgroups.
  \item \textbf{Practical Implications:} The method is particularly useful for multi-omics studies, biomarker discovery, and patient stratification, offering a scalable and interpretable approach for integrating diverse data types. This can aid in personalized medicine and targeted therapeutic strategies.
  \item \textbf{Future Directions:} Future work could explore supervised modeling with subtype labels to enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, applying iClusterVB to other real-world cancer datasets or extending it to incorporate temporal or spatial data could further validate its utility and expand its applications.
